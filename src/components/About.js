            As a Software Developer just beginning my career. 
            I am searching for a company whose environment emphasizes mentorships and growth; and a company where development challenges are a high priority. 
            I have a thirst for hard to solve problems; when coupled with my varied background in direct customer focused industries such as Travel and Tourism.  
            With the experience of running my own business in both the Equine and Trade industries allows for a unique outlook on how to achieve desired results. 
            Plus a healthy appreciation for team-based soft skills.
